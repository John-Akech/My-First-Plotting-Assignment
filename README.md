# My-First-Plotting-Assignment

This project explores vehicle fuel efficiency and GHG scores using data on engine size, emissions, and fuel type. Visualizations like histograms and heatmaps reveal relationships between CO2 emissions, engine size, and GHG scores. Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used for analysis.
